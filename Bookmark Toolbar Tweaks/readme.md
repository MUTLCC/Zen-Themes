This theme contains a few small tweaks to the bookmarks toolbar:
- Center the toolbar
- Hide bookmark or bookmark folder icons

Each of these settings can be enabled individually by changing the configuration in the settings page.

To enable the bookmarks toolbar, press Ctrl + Shift + B

Feel free to suggest additional tweaks.
