# Hide Window Buttons

With this theme you can hide the buttons for minimizing, maximizing or closing a window.

You can still perform these actions by pressing Alt + Space.

* For Linux and Windows users, each of these buttons can be hidden separately by changing the configuration in the settings page.
* For macOS users, all three window control buttons will be automatically hidden with this theme.
